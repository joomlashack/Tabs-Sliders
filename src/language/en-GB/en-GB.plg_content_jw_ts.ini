JW_PLG_TS_CHOOSE_LAYOUT_TEMPLATE="Choose a layout template"
JW_PLG_TS_CHOOSE_LAYOUT_TEMPLATE_DESC="Choose a layout template for both tabs and sliders. This plugin utilizes on-the-fly MVC template overrides.

The plugin will then pickup the new sub-template auto-magically, without you editing any XML file or doing any other non-designer work!"

JW_PLG_TS_TAB_CONTENT_HEIGHT_DESC="Enforce fixed height for active tab content in pixels. Use this option when your overall height is limited. Enter 0 or clear this option if you change your mind."
