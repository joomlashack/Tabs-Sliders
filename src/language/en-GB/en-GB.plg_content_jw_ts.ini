PLG_CONTENT_JW_TS_DESCRIPTION = "Tabs and Sliders makes adding tabs or sliders (accordions) inside your content a piece of cake. Using a simple syntax you can easily organize your content in tabs or sliders making it better stand out and easier to navigate: for example, organizing your long product descriptions in tabs improves the readability of your product pages, which means more happy customers!"

PLG_CONTENT_JW_TS_CHOOSE_LAYOUT_TEMPLATE_DESC = "Choose a layout template for both tabs and sliders. This plugin utilizes on-the-fly MVC template overrides. What this means is that you can create a new sub-template folder for this plugin within your Joomla! template's /html/jw_ts/ folder. The plugin will then pickup the new sub-template auto-magically, without you editing any XML file or doing any other non-designer work!"
